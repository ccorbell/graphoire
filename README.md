# Graphoire
An open-source collection of graph-theory elements and magical formulae.

## What Is Graphoire?

Graphoire is a collection of software tools for graph theory exploration and research.

I'm writing these while learning graph theory so there will be some rough edges
for awhile. I'm hoping to build a library for exploration and research that is
expressive, versatile, and eventually robust.

### Programming Language: python (...)

Graphoire is initially being developed in python but other language ports are possible.

### Dependencies

Some features of Graphoire rely on the **numpy** and **scipy** libraries - in particular,
sparse matrix and linear-algebra features.

### *Not yet for production!*

There are many graph theory toolsets out there, and in particular if you are looking for
production-quality graph analysis code for machine learning, data visualization, or 
similar, Graphoire is *not* a good choice at present.

Graphoire's design and source code organization ***will change regularly*** during its
inception phase, and its priority will be on conceptual structure rather than production
quality during this phase.

With that disclaimer made, you are welcome to use this code for your own purposes under the terms of the Apache 2.0 open source license.

# Documentation

This will be manifest eventually!

For now: you can explore Graphoire in a python environment by downloading the source and adding the `python-src` directory to your `$PYTHONPATH`.
