PIn general the problem domain here is a bipartition
where elements of one group have preferences for the other
group. This may be an exhaustive ranking such as is used for
stable matching problems, or sparser structures. 

One way we represent a preference is a weighted edge,
with a lower weight representing higher preference
(shorter 'preference distance').
