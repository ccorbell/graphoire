    Create a PrÃ¼fer code for a given Graph object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : a Graph object.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Raises if the algorithm cannot find leaves, which may happen if the 
        graph is not a tree.

    Returns
    -------
    code : array of integer vertex label values

    Behavior
    --------
    The algorithm creates a copy of the input graph on which it operates.
    It first labels the graph using 1-based integer-value labels. Then
    it applies the Prufer-code algorithm, finding lowest-label-valued leaf
    and recording its neighbor's label, then deleting the leaf, etc.,
    until only two vertices remain.
    
    So the return value is an integer sequence (returned as a python list)
    built from one-based vertex labels.
